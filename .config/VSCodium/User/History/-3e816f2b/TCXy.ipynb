    "+ **Lo-fi** (_low fidelity_) is a genre of music which aims to recreate the feeling of older, **low quality recordings**. As such, those tracks are brought closer to white noise, which is considered by many as **soothing**, and **relaxing**. \n",
    "+ Because of this, lo-fi music is usually used as **background music for work and study**."
